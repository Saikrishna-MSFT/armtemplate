This app provides a snapshot of all concurrent conversations that users are engaging on varied topics. The logged in user could join one of the active conversations or choose to spin up a new one on a specific topic, inviting up to 5 colleagues. Once a conversation is kicked off, following the Teams meeting feature, one could add more people or chat with the group."
